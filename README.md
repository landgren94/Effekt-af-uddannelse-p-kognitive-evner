Abstract: 
Cognitive ability has an significant impact on several socioeconomic outcomes such as health, educational performance, consumption patterns etc.
Education length have been shown to have a positive impact on cognitive ability.
However, it remains unknown, whether social class affects the impact of education on cognitive ability. 
In this paper I provide new evidence suggesting that the causal effect of education on cognition vary in the population across individuals with different social backgrounds. 
I use SHARE data and schooling reforms in several European countries as instruments for educational attainment.
I find that an extra year of education has a significant protective effect on cognition; the cognition score increases by 0,24 standard deviation on average. 
I find that heterogeneity and selection play a part in schooling decisions, and that the reforms mainly change the schooling decisions of individuals from the low socioeconomic class. 
Using the data available in SHARELIFE on early life conditions of the respondents such as socioeconomic status, health and performance at school, I identify that individuals from a higher socioeconomic class receives a larger marginal return on cognition from education than average, whereas individuals form a lower socioeconomic class receives a smaller marginal return on cognition from education than average. 
This implies that the impact of education on cognition is strongly affected by ones social class.
